"""LLM backend construction for the agentic pipeline.

Two backends are supported, selected by name:
- "groq": gpt-oss-120b via Groq's API. Recommended, since Groq's free
  tier has much more headroom than Gemini's, whose free tier caps at 20
  requests per day for a given model, easy for a single student to
  exhaust mid-lab from normal use plus a couple of retries. This used to
  be Meta's Llama 3.3 70B, but Groq dropped that model from its catalog
  at some point after this was first built; confirmed live against
  Groq's /v1/models endpoint that Llama chat models are gone entirely
  and gpt-oss-120b is available and supports tool calling.
- "gemini": Google's Gemini API, same convention as Lab 2's setup
  (config/.env, GOOGLE_API_KEY).

A third backend, xAI's Grok, was supported earlier in this project but
has been dropped entirely; it's no longer an option anywhere in this
codebase.

Model names are centralized here so a future deprecation (this already
happened once, when gemini-2.0-flash was retired mid-project) only needs
a fix in one place.

Every backend is also built with a request timeout. Without one, a
provider that hangs (a dropped connection, a stuck generation) blocks the
call indefinitely with nothing to catch and display, since there's no
exception to catch until one actually happens. A hung student session
that never errors and never responds is a real failure mode this closes:
the call now surfaces as a normal, catchable timeout instead of leaving
the chat widget stuck on "Thinking..." forever.

A backend can also have more than one key configured: a free Gemini
account can generate several keys, each with its own separate rate
limit, so a student with GOOGLE_API_KEY_1 through GOOGLE_API_KEY_10 set
gets several times the effective quota of any single one. Numbered keys
(`{ENV_VAR}_1`, `{ENV_VAR}_2`, ...) take priority over the plain
singular variable if both are present; get_api_keys() returns all of
them, in order, and build_llm_for_backend() is what turns that list into
a single model that rotates between them (see llm_key_rotation.py).
build_llm() itself still only ever takes one key at a time -- it's the
low-level primitive both get_api_keys()-based construction and the tests
build on.
